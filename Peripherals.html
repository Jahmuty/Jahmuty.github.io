					<li><b>Mouse</b></li>
					<p>A Mouse Is A Device That Can Be used internally meaning that you could have it built-in a laptop for example or you can use it externally.
				As many High-End and Medium-End manafactures make them for external use. These devices are capable of high-quality and high-speed Tracing!.</p>

					<li><b>Keyboard</b></li>
					<p>A Keyboard is just like the mouse it can be internally equipped for laptops and can be used externally for laptops and Desktop pc's these days the keyboard 
					is capable of fast detection as it is needed for the gaming world as well as the typer community .</p>

					<li><b>Headphones</b></li>
					<p>Audio devices have come far from what they used to be in the past, before they were barely capable of replaying the audio you wanted to listen to 
					and they weighed around 4.5 Kilograms that is like having a Air Fryer on your shoulders for hours upon hours! However, Today these devices are reactive and can 
					even handle 7D audio which gives you the feeling of being in a concert while listening to music or hearing someone walking from your right to your left.</p>

					<li><b>Speakers</b></li>
					<p>As I mentioned in the previous passage Audio devices were at the worst point in comparison to other peripherals created. However, these days speakers can 
					be as good as concert like speakers for more than HALF THE PRICE!!!</p>
